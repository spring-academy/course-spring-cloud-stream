## In This Course

In this course, you'll learn the fundamental concepts that govern event-driven systems. Then, you'll reinforce your learning by building an a real-world inspired event-driven system: a system that processes financial transactions from a "Family Cash Card" business - a service for families to manage spending in the form of digital debit cards.

By building a system that analyzes and "enriches" this financial data, you'll learn how to implement event-driven concepts using Spring Cloud Stream.

## Course Outcomes

- Learn the overarching concepts at the foundation of all event-driven systems.
- Learn how Spring Cloud Stream implements these concepts, and how can use these implementations to build your own systems.
- Build a fully functional event-driven system with Spring and Spring Cloud Stream.

## Prerequisites

- A working knowledge of the Java language and Java ecosystem
- A working knowledge of Spring Boot
- Bonus: a working knowledge of messaging middlewares and REST APIs
