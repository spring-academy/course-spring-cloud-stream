Congratulations! You've add a **Processor** microservice application, making our Family Cash Card ecosystem a true *system* of multiple Spring Cloud Stream applications collaborating to both source and now process transaction data.

You've also learned how to properly specify the input and output topics for the **Source** and **Processor** applications so they can fetch and send data to the middleware.
