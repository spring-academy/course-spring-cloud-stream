Congratulations! You have just accomplished several valuable objectives:

- You successfully implemented a second means to publishing data to Spring Cloud Stream: and on-demand method using `StreamBridge`.
- You implemented a controller endpoint that uses the `StreamBridge` to publish transaction data on-demand rather than relying on a fixed-schedule publishing scheme.
- You refactored the application to correctly implement separation of concerns, allowing us to control our test results.

Good job!
