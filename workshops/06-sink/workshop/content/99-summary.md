Congratulations! You've added a third microservice application to our Family Cash Card system: a **Sink** Spring Cloud Stream app receives data from the middleware and both logs that data to the console and and writes it to disk. You also learned how Spring Cloud Stream handles default bindings when multiple are available (that is: it doesn't!) and learned how to properly configure multiple bindings.

We have a real Spring Cloud Stream system now!
